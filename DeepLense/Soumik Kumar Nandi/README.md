# Simulation and Classification of Gravitational Lensing based on Vortex-Substructures
A gravitational lens is a distribution of matter (such as a cluster of galaxies) between a distant light source and an observer, that is capable of bending the light from the source as the light travels towards the observer. Gravitational Lensing is used to detect other galaxies/planets when a foreground star acts as a lense for the distant galaxy/planet. Light bends around the foreground star creatinh halos of light of the background galaxy which is in same line of sight. Gravitational Lensing images requires very high computing power and telescopic power. Right now Gravitational Lensing Images are limited to very few. PyAutoLens is a Python module for simulating such images
