The Vortex Substructure so generated can be classified into one of the three classes namely - Vortex Substructure, 
Spherical Substructure and No-Substructure. We feed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to learn the Image Representation
of each class. The goal here is not to only classify images but also detect anomalies. Few Main Reasons for Using Conv-Autoencoder are-
documented into the Architecture.docx file.
